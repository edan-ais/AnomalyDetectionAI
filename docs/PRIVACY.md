Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 05-07-2025

This Privacy Policy describes how DataSpace and its parent company, Analytic Intelligence Solutions ("we," "us," or "our"), collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the DataSpace demonstration.

Information Collection
The DataSpace demo uses local browser storage to store:

- Uploaded file types
- Uploaded file content
- Uploaded file names
- Uploaded file changes made in DataSpace
- All uploaded file information

Data Storage and Transmission
All information is stored entirely on your device or within your personal, shareable file copy using our proprietary DataSpace technology. No data is transmitted to our servers. DataSpace operates without requiring external server connections for its core functionality.

Data Sharing
When you choose to share content with others, a copy of the DataSpace file with your selected data attached is created. You control exactly what information is shared and with whom.

Security
DataSpace implements multiple security measures:

- File execution occurs in isolated sandbox environments
- DataSpace technology automatically neutralizes potentially malicious code
- No server connections means no vulnerability to typical server-side attacks

Analytics and Tracking
The DataSpace demonstration does not use cookies, tracking technologies, or analytics tools that send data to third parties.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version will always be available within the application.
